# Kaggle_Titanic

This is jupyter notebook for "Titanic survive prediction" competition on Kaggle.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most of demos of this competition use ensemble method such as random forest or gradient boosting to get good scores, but I want to try
deep learning method and see how's the performance on the data.

I get the 80.382% prediction rate for this task by using deep artificial neural network(ANN) with feature engineering, auto hyper-parameter 
tuning and regulization. 

Please check the detailed notes in notebook.
